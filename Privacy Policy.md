# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: July 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how **I** handle the personal data you provide when using NS-Shift-Planner.

## 1. Information I Collect

- **Names:** The only personal data collected and stored are names you enter in the app for shift planning purposes.
- **Session Data:** Sessions are managed using randomly generated session IDs. These session IDs serve as access keys to your session data.  
  You are responsible for keeping your session ID private to prevent unauthorized access.
- **No Emails or User IDs:** I do not collect or store email addresses, user IDs, or other personally identifiable information.

## 2. How I Use Your Information

- To store and manage your shift planning data securely.
- To provide and improve the NS-Shift-Planner service.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- All data is stored securely using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
- Session data is accessible only via the unique session ID.
- I do not share your data with third parties except as required by law or to comply with Firebaseâ€™s policies.

## 4. User Control and Privacy Options

- If you want additional privacy or to keep your data offline, you can download your projects as a ZIP file directly from the app.  
- After downloading, you can reset or clear the session in the app to remove your data from the online storage.  
- This way, you maintain full control over your data and can keep it private as you prefer.
- Additionally, under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3.0, you are free to clone or fork this project and run the app locally on your own machine.  
Running the app locally allows you to manage your data entirely on your devices, further enhancing your privacy and control.
